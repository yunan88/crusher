Phosphorus Fertilizer: The Original and Commercial Sources. Phosphorus can be recovered and used over and over again if present in sufficient concentrations dissimilar to oil,which is lost once it is used.Between the phosphate reserves and the food which we eat,up to 80% of P is lost in the process from production of fertilizers,application of phosphate on fields,in food processing and final. Phosphorus solubility in basaltic glass: Limitations for.
