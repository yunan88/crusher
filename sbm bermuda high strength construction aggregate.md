Effect of Aggregates On Strength Of Concrete Engineering. Aggregates gradation also have an influence on the compressive strength of concrete.Concrete strength increases when using dense gradation and increasing fines modulus of aggregates.By increasing fines modulus surface area of aggregates goes on increasing.With the increase in surface area more bond surface will be available and due to this stronger bond will be formed and also this. Freeze Thaw Resistance Portland Cement Association When water freezes,it expands about 9 percent.As the water in moist concrete freezes it produces pressure in the pores of the concrete.If the pressure developed exceeds the tensile strength of the concrete,the cavity will dilate and rupture.The accumulative effect of successive freeze thaw cycles and disruption of paste and aggregate can.
