Compression Molding of Gypsum Blocks Using Ecological Brick The blocks also did not achieve satisfactory performance in water absorption tests.In this context,Kanno [5] studied the high performance plaster with compressive strengths around 90 MPa.The samples were molded applying UCOS method (humidifiion,compaction and drying).Initially,the gypsum powder (HH) is wet Phenomena of Capillarity and Drying in Gypsum Blocks. The construction market has at its disposal more and more technical solutions in sealing materials that allow cost reduction and short term execution for construction companies.Among these solutions are the so called gypsum blocks.In spite of their countless advantages when it comes to their use as masonry sealing material,there are limits to the use of gypsum blocks: due to their low.
