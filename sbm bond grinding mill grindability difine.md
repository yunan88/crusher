Bond Ball Mill Index Test JKTech Measuring ore grindability in balls mills.The Bond Ball Mill Work Index is a measure of the resistance of the material to grinding in a ball mill.It can be used to determine the grinding power required for a given throughput of material under ball mill grinding conditions. USING THE SMC TEST® TO PREDICT COMMINUTION. The work index covering grinding in tumbling mills of coarse sizes is labelled M ia.The work index covering grinding of fine particles is labelled M ib (Morrell,2008).M ia values are provided as a standard output from a SMC Test® (Morrell,2004a) whilst M ib values can be determined using the data generated by a conventional Bond ball mill. Procedure for determination of ball Bond work index in the. Starting from the first order grinding kinetics defined by means of the Bond ball mill,this paper discusses a simplified procedure for a rapid determination of the work index by just two grinding tests.The applicability of the simplified procedure has been proved on.

Bond Work Index The grindability of coal varies significantly depending on composition and is commonly assessed by the Hardgrove Grindability Index,or HGI,which is much the same as the relative ease or difficulty of grinding ores as assessed by the Bond Work Index (Bond,1961). AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills &amp; Circuits Mining Mill. Mill Type Overview.Three types of mill design are common.The Overflow Discharge mill is best suited for fine grinding to 75 106 microns.; The Diaphram or Grate Discharge mill keeps coarse particles within the mill for additional grinding and typically used for grinds to 150 250 microns.; The Center Periphery Discharge mill has feed reporting from both ends and the product discharges.
