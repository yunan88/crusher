Does Insulation Cause Corrosion? Firwin Corp Dec 23,2019 · Corrosion under insulation (CUI) is a well documented problem in processing plants,occurring when moisture builds up underneath the surface of an insulating sleeve.Depending on the piping and insulation material types and the moisture source,substrates underneath insulation maybe vulnerable to multiple corrosion types,such as: Galvanic. Galvanic Series A galvanic series of metals and alloys in flowing seawater is shown in Table 9.50.It is observed that titanium would be a cathodic member of the couple,and hence it would not undergo galvanic corrosion.It can be observed that Ti would be cathodic to naval brass,carbon steel,zinc and copper,and would not be subjected to galvanic corrosion. Detecting and Eliminating Causes of Coil Corrosion "galvanic couple" is formed,and the phenomenon of galvanic corrosion occurs.In this galvanic couple,the metal that corrodes and the metal that is protected depend on their relative positions in the galvanic.
