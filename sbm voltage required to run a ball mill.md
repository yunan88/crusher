Circuits From Scratch Let’s Put LEDs in Things. Recall that batteries in series produce a higher supply voltage.LEDs connected in series likewise have a higher forward voltage.If your design uses multiple LEDs,and if the battery and LED voltages allow it,connecting in series like this is slightly more efficient,helping the battery run longer. Installation Note: Wide voltage fluctuations are common in many industrial areas; minimum and maximum voltage supplied to a machine while it is in operation must be known.U.S.National Electrical Code specifies that machines should operate with a variation of +5% to 5% around an average supply voltage.
