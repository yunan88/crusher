Mineral Deposit Value How to Calculate the Potential. As you can see in the example above,the deposit does not have to be enormous in size (only 500 meters long by 100 meters wide) to contain a valuable deposit (approximately 6 billion worth of minerals).However,in order to be as realistic as possible about this valuation,you can not assume that the complete ore body contains the same grade (i.e.2% copper and 1.5 gram per tonne gold).
