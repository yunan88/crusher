Mineral Processing.If the mineralogy of the ore shows that you can separate discrete particles of the mineral you want from the gangue components of the ore,then it is possible to physically concentrate the valuable mineral and reject the rest.The easiest method for achieving this is by gravity separation. Particle Analysis in Mining and Minerals Horiba Many of the particles encountered in mining are characterized by sieves (classifiers).Recent advances in computers,cameras,and software make image analysis practical for samples with sizes larger than several microns in diameter.As particle size decreases,sieving and or dynamic image analysis becomes more arduous or impossible and laser diffraction becomes the technique of choice. Lead and Zinc 6.1 Process Overview 6.1.1 Lead and Zinc Ore Mining Lead and zinc ore is nearly always mined below the surface of the ground.Some veins of ore lie as deep as several thousand feet but most deposits lie close to the surface.Lead and zinc ore is mined almost exclusively in underground operations,though a few surface operations do exist.
